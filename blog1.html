        <h2>skip if you don’t like intros</h2>
        <p class="justify"> Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in React. State
            management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL. The way I learn new things is I do a very basic
            course to get the feel of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the community. GraphQL
            being relatively new has fewer courses online. I did find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will
            review some day but this one course stands out. I have recommended this course to a lot many people I know.

        <h2>Some Random Topic</h2>
        <p class="justify">Aren’t there times in life where we wish we could just go back in time and tell yourself to
            do something better. To start a project with a better approach, to share your learnings with your younger
            self. The classic I-need-a-time-machine to-fix this code! It would just save so much time refactoring your
            code. Like many of you who are reading this code, I learned React/Redux from online videos and tutorials.
            Many of these tutorials are outdated, and or made too easy for the students to understand React. These were
            never intended to be production level code.

            I have been working on React almost exclusively from past one year and have been reading and writing code.
            Below tips are from my personal experiences of refactoring code not once but many times.</p>

        <h2> The Lion and the Mouse</h2>
        <p class="justify">A lion was once sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started running up and down his body just
            for fun. This disturbed the lion’s sleep, and he woke up quite angry. He was about to eat the mouse when the
            mouse desperately requested the lion to set him free. “I promise you, I will be of great help to you someday
            if you save me.” The lion laughed at the mouse’s confidence and let him go.

            One day, a few hunters came into the forest and took the lion with them. They tied him up against a tree.
            The lion was struggling to get out and started to whimper. Soon, the mouse walked past and noticed the lion
            in trouble. Quickly, he ran and gnawed on the ropes to set the lion free. Both of them sped off into the
            jungle.</p>
